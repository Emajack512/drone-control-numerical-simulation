# Drone Control — Numerical Simulation

Portfolio repository showcasing my work as **Controls Lead** in a multirotor drone project.

## What I did (Controls Lead)
- Designed the control architecture for stabilization (attitude control: roll/pitch/yaw)
- Implemented tuning and validation workflow using numerical simulation
- Defined control/mixing strategy and test scenarios to verify stability
- Standardized the team's numerical-methods workflow (integration, simulation scenarios, validation metrics) to ensure consistent results across contributors


## What’s not included
- Remote control firmware and hardware (owned by teammates)
- Team-private implementation details not required for a public portfolio

## Project overview
A multirotor drone requires stable control of attitude and (optionally) altitude. This repo documents the **modeling + control design + numerical simulation** used to validate the controller before/alongside real-world testing.

## Repository contents
- `/docs` — control design notes, diagrams, tuning procedure, short report
- `/media` — plots, screenshots, photos/videos
- `/simulation` — numerical simulation scripts/models (public-safe)
- `/control` — controller code or pseudocode (public-safe)

## Quick links
- Docs: `docs/`
- Media: `media/`

## Status
Completed (portfolio version). Continuous improvements: clearer docs, more plots, and demos.
